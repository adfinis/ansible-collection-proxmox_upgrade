## ðŸš§ This is a work in progress. Dont use in production just yet! ðŸš§

This should serve as a TEMPLATE to create new collections.

A brief description of the collection goes here.

To create a new repository from this template, follow the instructions at [Creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).  Afterwards, clone your newly created repository and do a `git grep TEMPLATE` to find all the places where changes are required.

You can submit new releases of your collection to Ansible Galaxy simply by creating a git tag and pushing it to Github. The tag name must consist of `v` followed by a semver version number, e.g. `v1.0.0`.

## Roles

Provide a short description of each role in your collection.  If your collection contains other artifacts such as playbooks or plugins, describe them as well.

### `adfinis.proxmox_upgrade.proxmox_upgrade`
